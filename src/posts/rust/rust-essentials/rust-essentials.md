## Introduction to Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that has quickly grown in popularity since its initial release in 2015. Created by Mozilla Research, Rust aims to bring greater speed, safety, and concurrency to systems-level development. 

Rust provides the performance and low-level control often associated with languages like C and C++, but includes a number of higher-level features as well. The Rust compiler enforces memory safety and thread safety at compile time, eliminating many classes of bugs and vulnerabilities that plague other system languages.

The language has evolved significantly over the past decade, incorporating ideas and paradigms from numerous other languages. Rust continues to be driven by an active open source community focused on improving performance, productivity, and robustness when building system software.

Some key strengths of Rust include:

- **Memory safety** - The borrow checker prevents dangling pointers, double frees, and data races at compile time. No need for garbage collection.
- **Zero-cost abstractions** - Features like traits and generics enable abstraction and code reuse without runtime costs.
- **Concurrency** - Lightweight tasks and message passing provide concurrency support "out of the box".
- **Speed** - Rust competes with C and C++ for performance without compromising safety.
- **Reliability** - The compiler guarantees thread and memory safety, reducing crashes and security holes.

Rust has proven to be an excellent choice for developing low-level system components like operating systems, embedded devices, network services, and performance-critical applications. As the language matures, Rust continues to gain traction in fields like game development, web programming, and data science as well.

## Why Rust for System Developers

The system programming landscape has traditionally been dominated by languages like C, C++, and assembly. However, Rust offers some compelling advantages that make it an excellent choice for developing fast, safe, and efficient system software.

### The Challenges of System Programming

System programming involves writing software that interacts closely with computer hardware while still providing services for higher-level applications. This includes operating systems, device drivers, databases, web servers, compilers, and more. 

Crafting robust system software can be challenging for several reasons:

- **Memory management** - Manually allocating and freeing memory is complex and prone to errors like leaks, double frees, and invalid accesses. These can lead to crashes or vulnerabilities.
- **Concurrency** - With multiple threads accessing data, race conditions and synchronization bugs can occur. These are often subtle and difficult to debug.
- **Isolation** - Poor isolation between software components can cause crashes when one component fails. Lack of isolation also leads to vulnerabilities like memory safety issues.
- **Low-level control** - Tight hardware integration requires operating at a low level using tricky, unsafe code in languages like C or assembly.

Languages like C and C++ provide excellent performance but place the burden of navigating all of these pitfalls solely on the developer.

### Rust to the Rescue

Rust provides a unique combination of speed, safety, and control - making it a fantastic language for developing robust system components:

- **Memory safety** - Rust's borrow checker ensures memory is managed correctly without garbage collection overhead. Entire classes of memory bugs are compile-time errors in Rust.
- **Fearless concurrency** - Rust's ownership model guarantees thread safety at compile time. Lightweight tasks and message passing make concurrent code fast and easy.
- **Zero-cost abstractions** - Traits, generics, and functional patterns provide polymorphism and code reuse without runtime costs.
- **Control** - Rust provides fine-grained control over memory layouts, pointer aliasing, and other low-level details.

By leveraging Rust's strengths, system developers can write blazingly fast, leak-free code without compromising system resources or safety. Rust enables writing robust system software with greater confidence.

## Hello, World!

Now that we've covered what Rust is and why it's useful for systems programming, let's look at a simple "Hello, World!" program to see Rust in action. This will demonstrate how to write, compile, and run a basic Rust program.

### Writing the Hello World Program

Here is the full source code for a simple Hello, World! program in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

Let's break down what's happening in this program:

- `fn main()` - The `main` function is the entry point for a Rust program. All Rust programs must have a `main` function.
- `println!` - This macro prints a string to the screen. The `!` indicates it's a macro rather than a normal function.
- `"Hello, World!"` - This string literal is passed to `println!` to be printed.

And that's all there is to it! This program prints `Hello, World!` to the terminal.

### Compiling and Running

To compile this program, save the code in a file named `main.rs` and run:

```
rustc main.rs

``` 

This will compile the program and generate a binary executable called `main`. 

Then to run the program, execute:

```
./main
```

You should see `Hello, World!` printed to the terminal. And that's all there is to compiling and running a simple Rust program!

## Variables and Mutability

Now that we can print "Hello, World", let's look at how we can store data in variables and work with mutability in Rust.

### Declaring Variables

To declare a variable binding in Rust, use the `let` keyword:

```rust
let x = 5;
```

This creates an immutable binding named `x` with the value `5`. 

By default, bindings in Rust are immutable. To make a binding mutable, add `mut` before the binding name:

```rust
let mut y = 5; // y is mutable
```

### Constants

In addition to variables, Rust also supports constants which are immutable values bound to a name. Constants are defined using the `const` keyword:

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

Constants differ from `let` variables in a few ways:

- Constants must have their type annotated 
- Constants can only be set to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or other runtime value
- By convention, constants are named with all uppercase letters

For example:

```rust
let x = 5; // Type can be inferred

const Y: i32 = 10; // Type must be annotated

let z = get_random(); // Can call a function 

const W: f64 = get_random(); // INVALID - cannot call function
```

Constants are useful for defining names for fixed values that may be used throughout your program. The name documents the meaning rather than just the value itself.

### Variable Scope

Variables in Rust have scope - they are only available within the block they are declared in.

```rust
let x = 5;

{
let y = 10;
} 

// x is still in scope here, but y is not
```

### Shadowing

We can reuse a variable name using shadowing:

```rust
let x = 5;
println!("{}", x); // prints 5
{
    println!("{}", x); // prints 5
    let x = 10;        // x is shadowed here from the outer one
    println!("{}", x); // prints 10
}
println!("{}", x); // prints 5
let x = x + 1; // shadows previous binding
println!("{}", x); // prints 6
```

This allows reusing a variable name rather than forcing unique names everywhere.

### Mutability

For a mutable binding like `mut x`, we can modify it:

```rust
let mut x = 5; 
x = 6; // allowed as x is mutable
```

This mutability allows for modifying variables when needed. However, Rust prefers immutability when possible for safety and concurrency.

Here is an expanded explanation of shadowing vs updating immutable variables in Rust:

### Shadowing vs. Updating

Shadowing and updating a mutable variable are two different concepts in Rust:

- **Shadowing** redefines a variable in a new scope, hiding the previous binding. This allows reusing a variable name.
- **Updating** mutates a mutable variable in-place. The same binding is changed.

For example:

```rust
let x = 5; 

{
let x = x + 1; // shadows x, doesn't modify the original binding
println!("inner x is: {}", x); // prints 6
} 

println!("outer x is: {}", x); // prints 5, not modified 

let mut y = 5;

{
y = y + 1; // updates y in-place
println!("inner y is: {}", y); // prints 6
} 

println!("outer y is: {}", y); // prints 6, y was mutated
```

Shadowing creates a new variable, while mutating updates the original binding.

### Type Annotations

Rust is statically typed, so every variable binding has a type. However, in many cases Rust can infer the type automatically:

```rust
let x = 5; // Type i32 is inferred
```

We can also explicitly annotate the type if desired:

```rust
let x: i32 = 5;
```

This states that `x` is an `i32` integer type.

Type annotations are required when:

- The type cannot be inferred
- There is ambiguity 
- Added clarity is desired

For example:

```rust
let x: f64 = 5.0; // f64 annotated, i32 inferred otherwise 

let y: &str = "hello"; // Reference needs annotation
```

Annotating types makes code clearer and serves as in-code documentation. The compiler also enforces that the assigned value matches the annotation.

## Scalar Data Types

Rust provides a variety of scalar data types for storing simple values like integers, floats, booleans, and characters. Let's explore the built-in scalar types available in Rust.

### Integer Types

Rust provides both signed and unsigned integer types in fixed bit-widths. Some common examples:

- `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128` - signed integers 
- `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128` - unsigned integers

For example: 

```rust
let x: i32 = -123;
let y: u8 = 255;
```

### Floating Point Types

Rust has two primitive types for floating point numbers:

- `f32` - 32-bit float
- `f64` - 64-bit double

For example:

```rust
let x = 3.14159; // f64 by default
let y: f32 = 5.2;
```

### Boolean Type

Rust has a built-in `bool` type for boolean values `true` and `false`:

```rust 
let t = true;
let f: bool = false; 
```

Booleans are 1 byte in size.

### Character Type

Rust's `char` type represents a Unicode character:

```rust
let c = 'a';

``` 

`char` is 4 bytes in size and can represent any Unicode character.

### When to Use Each Scalar Type

- **Integers** - Use signed integers (`i32`, `i64`) for math or any time you need negative numbers. Use unsigned (`u32`, `u64`) for positive-only values like indices and bit patterns. Use sized integers like `u8` for optimization when values are small.

- **Floats** - Use `f64` for most floating point math. It provides double precision. Use `f32` if you need to save space or optimize for performance when less precision is acceptable.

- **Booleans** - Use `bool` for boolean logic, flags, and anytime you need a simple true/false value.

- **Chars** - Use `char` when you need a single Unicode character, like parsing text or tokens. Avoid using `char` for numeric values - use integers instead.

Some rules of thumb:

- Use unsigned integers for positive-only values
- Use `i64`/`u64` as general purpose integer unless you have a specific size need 
- Use `f64` for most floating point math
- Use `bool` for true/false flags and conditions
- Use `char` for single Unicode characters

Choosing the right scalar type in Rust ensures efficient code that matches the intended use case. Now let's look at...

## Tuples

Tuples are a compound data type in Rust that allow grouping multiple values of different types together in a fixed order. Tuples are useful for returning multiple values from functions or temporarily grouping related values.

### Creating Tuples

Tuples are defined by listing comma-separated values inside parentheses:

```rust
let tup = (500, 6.4, 1); // A 3-element tuple
```

Each position in the tuple has a type, inferred from the corresponding value:

```rust
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
```

Tuples can contain mixed types and can also be nested:

```rust
let nested = ((4, 'a'), 2.3, true); // Nested tuple
```

### Accessing Tuple Elements 

To access elements of a tuple, we can use dot notation with the index:

```rust 
let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

let (u, v, w) = tup;
println!(“{}”, u); // 500 – first element

let x = tup.0; // 500 - first element
let y = tup.1; // 6.4 - second element
```

This allows retrieving tuple elements conveniently. Tuples are useful for returning multiple values from functions or temporarily grouping related data. 

## Arrays

Arrays allow storing multiple values of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. Unlike tuples, arrays have a fixed length set at compile time.

### Creating Arrays

Array types are written as `[T; N]` where `T` is the element type and `N` is the fixed length. 

Arrays can be initialized using a literal with the same syntax:

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // i32 array of length 5
```

Alternatively, you can use the `vec!` macro to initialize an array:

```rust
let a = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // a is inferred as [i32; 5]
```

### Accessing Array Elements

Array elements are accessed using indexing syntax:

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3];

let first = a[0]; 
let second = a[1];
```

Attempting to access an invalid index will result in a panic.

### Array Operations

Common array operations include:

- Iterating through elements with a `for` loop
- Checking length with `array.len()`
- Slicing sections like `&array[..2]` 
- Comparing arrays with `==`

Arrays allow fixed-size contiguous storage when needed. 

### Modifying Array Elements

Unlike vectors, arrays have a fixed size set at compile time. However, if an array is mutable, we can modify elements by assigning to indexed positions:

```rust
let mut arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr[1] = 5; // Set second element to 5
```

The entire array can also be reassigned:

```rust
let mut arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr = [5, 6, 7]; // Reassign entire array
```

Note that arrays are stack allocated, so modifying large arrays can be expensive. Vectors are generally preferred for growable data.

Rules for modifying arrays:

- An array must be declared `mut` to be modified
- Elements can be modified by index assignment
- Entire array contents can be replaced 
- Array length cannot be changed  

## Vectors

Vectors provide a resizable array type in Rust. Unlike arrays, vectors can grow or shrink in size dynamically.

### Creating Vectors

Vectors are created using the `vec!` macro:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3]; // v: Vec<i32>
```

They can also be created empty:

```rust
let v = Vec::new();
```

Vector elements can be any copyable type.

### Modifying Vectors

Elements can be pushed to the end of a vector with `push()`:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2];
v.push(3);
```

Elements can be popped from the end with `pop()`:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
v.pop(); // Pops 3
```

Other modifying methods include `insert()`, `remove()`, `clear()`, etc.

### Reading Elements

Elements can be read using indexing syntax:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let x = v[1]; // x is 2
```

Vectors implement many helpful methods like `iter()` for iteration. Vectors provide a flexible way to store a resizable list of elements.

## Comparing Tuples, Arrays, and Vectors

Rust provides several compound data types for storing multiple values. Here we will compare tuples, arrays, and vectors - three options for grouping data.

### Key Differences
<script>
  import Table from '$lib/components/Table.svelte'
  let headers = ['Feature', 'Tuple', 'Array', 'Vector'];
  
  let rows = [
    ['Size', 'Fixed', 'Fixed', 'Resizeable'],
    ['Types', 'Mixed', 'Homogeneous', 'Homogeneous'],
    ['Heap/Stack', 'Stack', 'Stack', 'Heap'],
    ['Declaration', 'Parentheses', 'Brackets', '`vec!` macro']
  ];
</script>

<Table {headers} {rows} highlight_first_row={true} />

The key differences include:

- **Size** - Tuples have a fixed length while vectors can grow or shrink. Arrays are fixed size.
- **Types** - Tuples can contain values of different types, while array and vector elements must have the same type.
- **Allocation** - Tuples are allocated on the stack. Arrays can be stack or heap allocated. Vectors are always heap allocated.
- **Creation** - Tuples use parentheses, arrays use brackets, and vectors use the `vec!` macro.

### Methods

The available methods also differ:

- **Tuples** - Tuples have only a few methods like `tup.0` to access elements. No modification is allowed.
- **Arrays** - Arrays support methods like ` arr.len()` for length and `arr[idx]` for access. No built-in modification methods.
- **Vectors** - Vectors provide many methods like `push`, `pop`, `insert`, and `remove` for modifying data. They also have `iter()`, `len()`, and indexing support.

### Use Cases

- Use **tuples** for temporary groups of values or returning multiple values from a function.
- Use **arrays** when you need a fixed-size collection stored on the stack.
- Use **vectors** when you need a resizable heap-allocated collection.

So in summary, tuples, arrays, and vectors each serve different use cases in Rust. Pick the type that makes sense for a particular task.

## Slices

Slices provide a view into a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection. Slices are a powerful feature in Rust.

### Slice Syntax

Slices are created using brackets with a start and end index:

```rust
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &arr[1..3]; 
```

This creates a slice referencing elements 1 to 3. Slices do not copy data - they are just a view.

Slices can be mutable too:

```rust
let mut arr = [1, 2, 3];
let slice = &mut arr[0..2]; // Mutable reference
println!("{:?}", slice); // [1, 2]
slice[1] = 5;
println!("{:?}", slice); // [1, 5]
println!("{:?}", arr); // [1, 5, 3]
```

### Borrowing

Slices borrow a reference to the underlying data. The borrow checker ensures the original data is not moved while the slice is active.

Slices implement `Deref` to provide transparent access:

```rust
let arr = vec![1, 2, 3];
let slice = &arr[..];

println!("{}", slice[1]); // prints 2
```

### Use Cases

Slices are used when:

- Borrowing a section of an array or vector
- Passing a view into a large buffer 
- Allowing functions to access a section without taking ownership

Overall, slices provide an important view abstraction in Rust. They are used extensively when borrowing sections of collections.

## Strings and &str

Rust has two main string types - `String` and `&str`. Both support string slices, but they have some key differences.

### String

`String` is an owned, growable UTF-8 string type. Strings can be created from string literals:

```rust
let s = "Hello".to_string(); // s: String
```

Strings can grow and their contents can be modified:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("Hello");
s.push_str(" World!"); // Growable
```

### &str

`&str` is a string slice - it borrows a view of a UTF-8 string. String literals have type `&str`: 

```rust
let s = "Hello"; // s: &str
```

`&str` cannot be directly mutated as it is borrowed.

### Ownership

The key difference is `String` owns its data while `&str` borrows. This impacts their creation, usage, and performance:

- `String` requires allocation and copying
- `&str` is just a view, efficient for small strings 
- Functions taking `&str` avoid costs of `String` creation

For owned, growable strings, use `String`. For string slices, use `&str`.

## String Literals

Let's now look at string literals in Rust and the differences between string literals and String/&str types.

### String Literal Syntax

String literals use double quotes:

```rust
let s = "hello"; // string literal
```

Escape characters like `\\n` can be used within string literals:

```rust
let s = "hello\\nworld"; // literal with escape
```

### Differences from String/&str

String literals have some differences from String and &str types:

- String literals are fixed at compile time, String/&str are runtime types.
- Literals don't support method calls, while String/&str have methods.
- Literal syntax is more convenient, but provides less flexibility.

For example:

```rust
let s = "hello"; // immutable literal

let mut s2 = String::from("hello"); // mutable String
s2.push_str(" world!"); // can modify at runtime
```

So while literals provide a nice syntax, String/&str have more functionality.

### Type of String Literals

The type of a string literal is `&static str` - an immutable reference with a static lifetime. This lifetime means the string data is valid for the entire duration of the program.

In summary, string literals provide a convenient syntax for string data at compile time. For mutable runtime strings, convert literals to a String or &str.

## Operators

Rust provides a variety of operators that can be used to perform operations on primitives and other types. Let's take a look at some common operators in Rust.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic math operations:

```rust
let x = 5 + 2; // Addition
let y = 10 - 3; // Subtraction 

let z = 5 * 2; // Multiplication
let w = 10 / 2; // Division

let r = 15 % 4; // Remainder
```

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean:

```rust
let a = 5;
let b = 2;

let c = a == b; // Equality
let d = a != b; // Inequality 

let e = a > b; // Greater than
let f = a < b; // Less than

let g = a >= b; // Greater than or equal to 
let h = a <= b; // Less than or equal to
```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators like `!`, `&&` and `||` can combine boolean values: 

```rust
let x = 5;

let y = !true; // Logical NOT 

let z = x > 0 && x < 10; // Logical AND

let a = x == 5 || x == 6; // Logical OR
```

Rust provides many more operators - bitwise, compound assignment, etc. Operators provide convenient syntactic sugar for operations on values.

## Functions

Functions are core building blocks in Rust. Let's look at how to define and call functions in Rust.

### Function Syntax

Functions are defined using the `fn` keyword:

```rust
fn print_hello() {
    println!("hello");
}
```

The function name follows `fn`. Parameters go inside the parentheses and the function body goes inside curly braces.

### Calling Functions 

To call a function, specify its name followed by parentheses:

```rust
print_hello(); // Call the function
```

Parameters can be passed during the function call:

```rust  
fn print_sum(x: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("{}", x + y);
}

print_sum(5, 10); // Passes 5 and 10 to the function
```

### Return Values

In Rust, functions and all code blocks return the value of the last expression implicitly. For example:

```rust
fn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y // No semicolon - returns the sum 
}

let result = sum(5, 10); // Assigns the returned sum
```

If a semicolon is added after the last expression, the function would return `()` (unit type) instead.

The `return` keyword can be used to return early before the end of the function body:

```rust 
fn check_limit(x: i32) -> bool {
  if x > 100 {
      return true; // Returns early here 
  }
false // This line does not execute if return above is reached
}
```

`return` is only needed when you want to return before the end of the function body.

The `?` operator is also commonly used to propagate errors:

```rust
fn read_file(path: &str) -> Result<String> {
let contents = fs::read_to_string(path)?; // Return early if error
Ok(contents)
}
```

## Control Flow

Control flow allows a Rust program to conditionally execute code based on different paths. Let's look at `if..else` conditionals and loops in Rust.

### if..else Conditionals

The `if` expression allows conditional branching:

```rust
let x = 5;

if x > 0 {
    println!("x is positive"); 
} else {
    println!("x is not positive");
}
```

The curly braces denote a conditional block. `else if` can also chain multiple conditions:

```rust
if x > 0 {
    // x is positive
} else if x < 0 {
    // x is negative
} else {
    // x must be 0
}
```

### Loops

Rust provides `loop`, `while`, and `for` loops. 

A `loop` loops unconditionally:

```rust
loop {
    // repeats forever 
}
```

A `while` loops conditionally based on a boolean expression:

```rust
while x != 0 {
    // keep looping while x != 0
} 
```

A `for` loop iterates over a collection:

```rust
for i in 0..10 {
    // loops 10 times  
}
```

### Controlling loops

To end a loop early in Rust, the `break` keyword is used:

```rust 
let mut x = 0;

loop {
x += 1; 

if x == 10 {
    break; // Ends the loop if x is 10
}
}
```

The `continue` keyword skips the current iteration, but keeps looping:

```rust
for i in 0..100 {
if i % 2 == 0 { 
    continue; // Skip even numbers
}

println!("{}", i); // Prints odd numbers
}
```

### Loop Labels

To disambiguate between nested loops, Rust allows naming outer loops with labels:

```rust
outer: for x in 0..10 {
  'inner: for y in 0..10 {

      // Breaking the outer loop specifically
      if x * y > 20 {
          break outer; 
      } 
  }
}
```

Looping constructs allow repeating code execution conditionally or iteratively in Rust.
