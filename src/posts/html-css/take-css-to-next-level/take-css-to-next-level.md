CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to control the appearance and layout of web pages. Mastering intermediate CSS techniques will add more tools to your development toolbox.

## Recap: The ABCs of CSS 

Let’s first do a quick recap. The basic building blocks of CSS are:

- **Selectors** - target web page elements like headings, paragraphs, etc. 
- **Properties** - determine styling and behavior, like `color`, `font-size`, `display`.
- **Values** - set what the property will be, like `red`, `16px`, `block`.

With just selectors, properties and values you can modify text, colors, sizes and more.

## Advanced Selectors

As an aspiring web developer, getting a solid grip on crafting precise CSS selectors is a must-have skill. They allow you to target any element or groups of elements on a page for styling.

We’ll explore some advanced selector techniques to step up your CSS mastery.

```css
/* Element selector */
p {
    color: gray; 
}

/* ID selector */
#intro {
    font-size: 20px;
}

/* Class selector */  
.highlight {
    background: yellow;
}
```

These allow simple targeting by element type, id or class name.

## Introducing Advanced Selectors

But CSS selectors can get way more advanced by using:

- **Pseudo-classes** - target based on state e.g. hovered
- **Pseudo-elements** - target specific parts like first letter
- **Attribute selectors** - target elements with specific attributes
- **Combinators** – select based on relationship between elements 

...and more!

Let’s look at some examples.

## Target Element States Dynamically 

Pseudo-classes help select elements when users interact with them.

For example, change link colors on hover:

```css
/* Unvisited link */
a:link {
    color: blue; 
}

/* Visited link */
a:visited {
    color: purple;  
}

/* Hovered link */
a:hover  { 
    color: red;
} 
```

You can target ALL kinds of states - focus, active, checked, etc.

## Style Specific Portions

Pseudo-elements allow styling parts of an element.

Some common examples include:

```css  
/* First letter */
p::first-letter {
    font-size: 36px;  
}

/* First line */
p::first-line {
    font-weight: bold;
} 

/* Before content */ 
blockquote::before {
    content: open-quote;
}

/* After content */
blockquote::after {  
    content: close-quote;
}
```

This granular control takes styling deeper.

## Attribute and Combinator Superpowers

Attribute selectors target elements with specific HTML attributes or values.

Combinators select elements based on their location relative to others.

Here’s an example using both:

```css
/* Paragraphs inside elements with class="intro" */ 
.intro p {
    color: green;
} 

/* Images with alt text */
img[alt] {
    border: 1px solid gray;
}
```

Advancing your selector skills unlocks unlimited styling possibilities!

There’s much more we could cover - child selectors, adjacent sibling selectors and more. But this should give you a taste of what’s attainable on your CSS journey.

### Pseudo-Classes for Dynamic Control

Pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:nth-child()` trigger styling when users interact with elements or based on their position.

For example, change color when hovering over links:

```css 
    a:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

Or style every 3rd item differently: 

```css
    li:nth-child(3n) {
    background: grey;
}
```

### Combinators Target Elements in Relation

Combinators allow selecting elements based on their location relative to others.

For instance, style `<em>` only inside `.intro` paragraphs:

```css
    .intro em {
    color: rebeccapurple; 
} 
```

Skillful use of advanced selectors gives extensive control over styling.

## Responsive Design with Media Queries

Responsive design enables your site to adapt across mobiles, tablets, laptops and desktops - ensuring optimal viewing and interaction everywhere.

### Fluid Layouts Rescale Automatically  

Using `%` rather than `px` for width values in CSS creates stretchy fluid layouts that flex to fill space.

### Powerful Media Queries for Breakpoints

Media queries allow applying CSS only under certain conditions like specific viewport widths.

For example, rearrange layouts for smaller screens:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .sidebar {
        width: 100%; 
    }
}
```

This scales sites beautifully across device sizes.

## Animations and Transitions

Subtle CSS animations and transitions greatly boost user experience by adding motion and interactivity.

### From Point A to B with Transitions

Use the `transition` property to animate changes on hover or click, like fading buttons or growing thumbnails.

For example, fade links in on hover:

```css
a {
    opacity: 0.5;
    transition: opacity 0.3s; 
}

a:hover {
    opacity: 1;
} 
```

Grow image thumbnails on mouseover:

```css
img {
    width: 100px;
    transition: width 0.5s;
}

img:hover {
    width: 150px; 
}
```

### Keyframe Animations 

For more advanced sequences, `@keyframes` define stages of the animation allowing bouncing icons, rotating widgets and dynamic effects.

For example, a pulsating animation:

```css
@keyframes pulse {
0% {
    transform: scale(1);
}
50% {
    transform: scale(1.5);
}
100% {
    transform: scale(1);
}
}

.icon {
    animation: pulse 1s infinite;
}

```  

Bouncing loading dots:

```css 
@keyframes bounce {
0%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
}
50% {
    transform: translateY(-30px);
}
}

.loader span {
    animation: bounce 0.5s infinite alternate;
}
```

## Preprocessors Automate Repeated CSS

Preprocessors like SASS provide features lacking in native CSS - variables, nesting, mixins and more - improving workflow efficiency.

### SASS Streamlines Style Sheets  

SASS gets compiled into regular CSS. Advantages include:

**Variables** help centralize values like colors and fonts

**Mixins** define reusable blocks of styling to insert anywhere 

**Nesting** structures selectors neatly
