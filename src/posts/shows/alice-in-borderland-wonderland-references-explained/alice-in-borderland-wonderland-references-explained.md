With Netflix officially confirming that *Alice in Borderland* Season 3 will arrive in 2025, fans are eagerly awaiting the conclusion to this thrilling Japanese survival series. While we count down the months until Arisu and Usagi return to our screens, let's explore one of the most fascinating aspects of the show that many viewers might have overlooked: its rich tapestry of references to Lewis Carroll's beloved classics, *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Through the Looking-Glass*.

Far from being just a clever title, *Alice in Borderland* weaves Carroll's themes, characters, and motifs throughout its story in ways both obvious and subtle. Understanding these connections not only enhances our appreciation of the show but might also provide clues about what to expect in the final season.

## The Characters: Reimagined for the Digital Age

The most obvious parallel begins with our protagonist, Ryōhei Arisu, whose very name is the Japanese pronunciation of "Alice." Like Carroll's heroine, Arisu is suddenly thrust into a bizarre world that operates by unfamiliar rules. Both characters begin their journeys confused and overwhelmed but gradually adapt to their strange new environments.

The first moments of Arisu in Borderland directly mirror Alice's fall down the rabbit hole. When Arisu and his friends hide in a public bathroom to escape the police, they emerge to find Tokyo completely deserted – their ordinary world has vanished, replaced by something extraordinary and dangerous. This transition scene, with its disorienting lights and sudden silence, captures the same sense of displacement as Alice's gradual descent into Wonderland.

Yuzuha Usagi, whose surname literally means "rabbit" in Japanese, serves as this story's White Rabbit equivalent. While she doesn't carry a pocket watch or fret about being late, her exceptional climbing abilities and role as Arisu's guide through Borderland mirror the White Rabbit's function as Alice's entry point into Wonderland. In the manga, her character is even more explicitly connected to Carroll's rabbit, frequently leading Arisu to new game locations. Her athleticism transforms the White Rabbit's frantic energy into something more purposeful but equally compelling.

Perhaps the most direct character parallel is found in Mira, the Queen of Hearts. Like Carroll's monarch with her frequent cries of "Off with their head!", Mira presents a calm exterior that masks deadly intentions. Her croquet game in the manga is a direct nod to the Queen's favorite pastime in the original story, though the Netflix adaptation transforms this into a more psychological battle of wits. Both queens force our protagonists to navigate arbitrary rules where victory seems impossible.

The Queen of Hearts' game, with its emphasis on psychological manipulation rather than physical challenges, perfectly updates Carroll's portrayal of the Queen's illogical and emotionally volatile nature. Where Carroll used the absurdity of flamingo mallets and hedgehog balls to show the Queen's irrationality, the show uses Mira's mind games to create the same sense of a world where the rules constantly shift beneath the protagonist's feet.

Shuntarō Chishiya, with his mysterious smile and tendency to appear and disappear at crucial moments, bears a striking resemblance to the Cheshire Cat. His ability to understand the games before others and his detached amusement at the proceedings echo the cat's enigmatic guidance to Alice. Even his physical characteristics—slender build, distinctive hair, and knowing smirk—visually reference Carroll's feline creation. Director Shinsuke Sato emphasizes this connection through cinematography, often framing Chishiya in ways that highlight his observational role, watching events unfold from elevated positions much as the Cheshire Cat observed from tree branches.

Other characters have their Wonderland counterparts as well:

- Aguni embodies elements of both the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, with his volatile temperament and the twisted logic that governs his actions. His backstory with Hatter mirrors the "always tea time" imprisonment of Carroll's characters.

- Kuina's journey of self-transformation echoes the Caterpillar's questions about identity. Her wisdom about accepting change reflects the Caterpillar's philosophical nature.

- Niragi, with his destructive impulses and thievery, parallels the Knave of Hearts who stole the tarts – both characters serve as agents of chaos and represent unchecked malevolence.

## Borderland as Wonderland

Tokyo's abandoned cityscape serves as a modern Wonderland—a once-familiar place rendered strange and dangerous. Like Wonderland, Borderland operates according to its own internal logic that seems nonsensical to newcomers but gradually reveals its patterns.

The visual design of Borderland expertly updates Carroll's fantasy world for the digital age. Empty streets replace mysterious forests, abandoned buildings stand in for the various houses Alice visits, and game arenas substitute for the garden settings. Yet the sense of disorientation remains the same – a world that resembles our own but operates according to fundamentally different rules.

The Beach community in Season 1 parallels the Queen's garden, with its strict hierarchy and arbitrary rules of conduct. Just as the card soldiers in Wonderland frantically paint white roses red to please their queen, the Beach residents perform assigned tasks based on their card rankings. The power structures in both settings are maintained through fear and the constant threat of execution. This parallel becomes explicit during the militant takeover, which mirrors the chaotic croquet game from Carroll's story.

The various game venues scattered throughout the city function like Wonderland's distinct regions, each with its own challenges and inhabitants who have adapted to those specific environments. The shifting nature of these venues—appearing and disappearing as needed for each game—recalls the fluid geography of Wonderland, where locations seem to materialize based on narrative necessity rather than logical spatial relationships.

The mansion game in particular evokes the Mad Hatter's tea party, with its forced socialization, hidden dangers, and time-related mechanics. Just as Alice must navigate the peculiar social rules of the tea party, players must decipher the unspoken dynamics among the mansion's residents to survive. The game's time limit, constantly displayed on wristwatches, references the broken watch of the Mad Hatter and the theme of time as both enemy and constraint.

## Games as Wonderland Challenges

The playing card motif that structures the entire game system is the most obvious nod to Carroll's work, which prominently featured card characters (particularly in the Queen's court). Each suit's games reflect qualities associated with their symbols in both traditional card games and Carroll's text:

- Spades games emphasize physical strength and combat, like the gardening card soldiers
- Hearts games focus on emotional manipulation and psychological challenges, reflecting the Queen's volatile nature
- Diamonds games require intelligence and deception, mirroring the calculated madness of Wonderland's residents
- Clubs games test teamwork and social dynamics, similar to the complex social rules that govern Wonderland interactions

Many games involve altered perception, whether through literal substances or psychological manipulation, recalling Alice's experiences with the "drink me" potion and "eat me" cake that changed her size. These transformations force both Alice and Arisu to reconsider their understanding of themselves and their environments.

The King of Spades, with his seemingly unstoppable nature and monstrous presence, serves as this story's Jabberwocky—the ultimate physical threat that must be overcome through courage and tactical thinking. Like the poem in *Through the Looking-Glass*, his challenge represents the culmination of physical dangers in this world. The cinematography during these confrontations emphasizes his looming presence and seemingly supernatural abilities, much as the Jabberwocky is portrayed as nearly invincible until the protagonist discovers its weakness.

The Queen of Hearts' game, with its psychological manipulation and reality-questioning elements, echoes Alice's final confrontation with the Queen, where she realizes the court characters are "nothing but a pack of cards" and rejects the illogical rules of Wonderland. Both confrontations represent a protagonist coming to terms with the true nature of the world they've been navigating and making a crucial choice about how to respond to it.

## Visual and Cinematic Wonderland References

The show's visual language is filled with subtle nods to John Tenniel's original illustrations for Carroll's books. The production design team has acknowledged drawing inspiration from these classic images while updating them for a contemporary setting.

The recurring imagery of clocks and timepieces throughout the series evokes the White Rabbit's pocket watch and the broken clock at the Mad Hatter's tea party. Time in Borderland, like in Wonderland, often seems to function differently than in the real world – elastic in some moments and compressed in others.

Director Shinsuke Sato employs several cinematographic techniques that enhance the dreamlike quality associated with Wonderland:

- Extreme wide shots of empty Tokyo create the same sense of distorted scale that Alice experiences after drinking the potion
- Canted angles during tense moments reflect the topsy-turvy logic of Carroll's world
- Saturated color palettes in game venues contrast with the muted tones of "safe" areas, much as Wonderland's vibrant settings contrast with Victorian England

The beach arena's striking visual design—with its sharp divisions between areas and highly formalized structure—visually references the chessboard setting of *Through the Looking-Glass*, where spatial divisions represent power and movement is restricted according to specific rules.

## Thematic Parallels

Both stories deeply explore questions of identity. Just as Alice repeatedly questions "Who am I?" throughout her adventures, Arisu struggles to define himself in this new world. Both protagonists ultimately discover their true selves through confronting absurdity and danger.

The existential themes in *Alice in Borderland* expand on philosophical questions that Carroll merely hinted at. Where Alice's identity crisis is largely played for humor and gentle satire, Arisu's questioning becomes a profound meditation on purpose and meaning in a seemingly arbitrary universe. This reflects how the show adapts Carroll's Victorian children's fantasy for a modern adult audience grappling with contemporary existential concerns.

The tension between logic and madness permeates both narratives. In Borderland, players must apply rational thinking to survive games while simultaneously accepting the fundamental irrationality of their situation—much as Alice attempts to apply Victorian logic to Wonderland's madness. In both stories, characters who cling too rigidly to either extreme—pure logic or complete chaos—tend to fail, while those who can balance both perspectives survive.

The maturation theme in Carroll's work is amplified in *Alice in Borderland*. While Alice's journey can be read as a metaphor for growing up in Victorian society, Arisu's transformation is more explicit—from a directionless young man to someone who discovers purpose and meaning through his trials. Both narratives suggest that confronting the absurdity and danger of an unpredictable world is necessary for genuine growth.

## Cultural Context: Alice in Japanese Media

Carroll's work has a long history of influence in Japanese popular culture. From early translations in the Meiji era to the numerous manga and anime adaptations, *Alice in Wonderland* has been embraced and transformed by Japanese creators for over a century.

*Alice in Borderland* joins other notable Japanese adaptations like *Are You Alice?*, *Pandora Hearts*, and elements of *Kingdom Hearts* that reinterpret Carroll's work through a distinctly Japanese lens. These adaptations often emphasize the darker, more psychological aspects of Wonderland while maintaining its fundamental strangeness.

The manga creator Haro Aso has acknowledged Carroll's influence, stating in interviews that he wanted to explore how modern Japanese youth might respond to Wonderland-like challenges. By setting his story in Tokyo and focusing on contemporary characters, he brings Carroll's themes into dialogue with specific Japanese social concerns about purpose, belonging, and coming of age in a challenging economic environment.

## The Joker Card: A New Chapter

The appearance of the Joker card at the end of Season 2 introduces an element not present in Carroll's original works, potentially signaling the series' intention to move beyond its literary inspiration. In the manga, this represents a significant turning point in the story.

The Joker functions as a wild card that can change the rules—an apt metaphor for the Season 2 revelation that disrupted everything players thought they knew about Borderland. As one perceptive reviewer noted: "In a game of cards, a Joker is also a wild card. This was likely a little nod from the ferryman to say that they survived Borderland, but now their last game to survive is life itself."

In Carroll's work, the Joker might be most closely associated with the concept of nonsense itself—the undermining force that challenges established patterns. If the face cards represent authority and structure (however absurd), the Joker represents the potential to overturn even those rules. Its appearance suggests that Season 3 might question the very foundations established in the first two seasons.

## What to Expect in Season 3

With Netflix confirming that Kento Yamazaki and Tao Tsuchiya will return as Arisu and Usagi, Season 3 promises to continue exploring their journey. Director Shinsuke Sato's return ensures the series will maintain its visual style and narrative intensity.

The recently released teaser image showing three figures looking across a dystopian cityscape dominated by a giant Joker card suggests the final season may further blend reality with the game world. The caption "You're not ready for the final game" hints that everything we've seen so far might have been merely preparation for the ultimate challenge.

If the series continues its pattern of Carroll references, we might expect Season 3 to incorporate more elements from the often-overlooked sequel *Through the Looking-Glass*, particularly its chess motif and the theme of moving between worlds. The manga's handling of the final arc suggests we'll see a deepening of the literary parallels rather than an abandonment of them.

Looking at how the manga concludes certain storylines that the show has already adapted differently, we might expect significant departures that nevertheless maintain the spirit of Carroll's work. Just as the show transformed the Queen of Hearts' game from the manga's croquet match to a psychological battle, Season 3 will likely continue to reinterpret rather than directly translate both its source material and its literary inspirations.

## A Viewer's Guide to Catching Hidden References

For fans who want to spot more Carroll references in previous seasons before the new one arrives, here are some key moments to watch for:

- The opening sequence of Season 1, where the "rabbit hole" moment occurs as Tokyo empties
- Any scene featuring Chishiya observing others from a distance (Cheshire Cat parallels)
- The Beach's elaborate card-based hierarchy system
- Moments where characters question their memories or identities
- Games that involve changing sizes, perception, or spatial awareness
- Any mention of "madness" or characters being called "mad"
- The use of doors, hallways, and confined spaces as transitions between environments
- References to time, particularly when it seems to function strangely

Pay special attention to the episode titles and opening scenes, which often contain subtle nods to chapters from Carroll's books. The directors have confirmed that some episodes deliberately mirror the structure of specific Wonderland adventures.

## Conclusion

Understanding *Alice in Borderland* through the lens of its literary inspiration adds rich layers of meaning to an already compelling survival thriller. The parallels to Carroll's work aren't mere easter eggs but integral aspects of the show's structure and themes.

The genius of the adaptation lies in how it transforms Carroll's Victorian fantasy into a contemporary meditation on purpose and survival without losing the original's sense of wonder and disorientation. By reimagining Wonderland as Borderland, the series creates a world that feels both familiar to fans of the classic and fresh to new audiences.

As we await the final season in 2025, revisiting both the show and Carroll's original tales might reveal even more connections and possibly provide clues about how Arisu's journey will conclude. Will he, like Alice, eventually wake up and dismiss his adventures as a curious dream? Or will *Alice in Borderland* continue to subvert expectations, taking its literary inspiration in unexpectedly dark new directions?

Whatever the future holds for our players, one thing is certain: the game is far from over, and the most fascinating challenges may still lie ahead, down the rabbit hole and through the looking glass of Borderland.
